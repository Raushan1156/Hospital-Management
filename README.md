# Hospital Management System – Spring Boot  
![Status: In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-blue)

## Overview
Hospital Management System is a **Java Spring Boot backend service** designed to manage core hospital operations such as **secure user authentication, patient and doctor management**, and controlled access to APIs.

The project focuses on **real-world backend engineering practices**, including **JWT-based security, layered architecture, transaction management, and database integration using JPA/Hibernate**.

---

## Key Features
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Secure RESTful APIs
- Patient and Doctor management
- Transaction management with rollback handling
- Centralized exception handling
- Clean layered architecture

---

## Tech Stack
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security (JWT)**
- **Spring Data JPA / Hibernate**
- **PostgreSQL (Dockerized)**
- **H2 (Development / Testing)**
- **Maven**
- **Docker**
- **DBeaver**

---

## Application Ports
- **Application:** `http://localhost:9001`
- **PostgreSQL (Docker):** `localhost:9000`

---

## REST API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/signup` – Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` – Authenticate user and generate JWT

### Doctor APIs (Secured)
- `GET /api/doctor` – Fetch all doctors
- `GET /api/doctor?id={id}` – Fetch doctor by ID

### Patient APIs (Secured)
- `GET /api/patient` – Fetch all patients
- `GET /api/patient?id={id}` – Fetch patient by ID

> All `/api/**` endpoints require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

---

## Security Flow
1. User signs up using the signup API
2. User logs in and receives a JWT token
3. JWT token is sent with each secured request
4. Custom JWT filter validates token before request processing

---

## Project Structure
- `controller` – REST API layer
- `service` – Business logic
- `repository` – Data access (JPA)
- `entity` – Database entities
- `dto` – Request/response models
- `filter` – JWT authentication filter
- `exception` – Global exception handling

---

## Database Setup & Environment

### PostgreSQL (Dockerized)
- PostgreSQL runs inside a Docker container
- Container exposed on **port 9000**
- Application connects via JDBC using externalized configuration

### Database Inspection
- **DBeaver** is used to:
  - Inspect schema generated by Hibernate
  - Validate entity relationships
  - Debug persisted data and transactions

### Configuration
- Database properties are managed via `application.yaml`
- Hibernate dialect configured for PostgreSQL
- Environment separation between **H2 (dev/testing)** and **PostgreSQL (containerized)**

---

## Challenges Solved & Learnings
- Resolved PostgreSQL timezone compatibility issues between JVM and database
- Debugged Lombok constructor and annotation processing issues in IntelliJ
- Migrated smoothly from H2 to PostgreSQL without breaking application flow
- Gained hands-on experience with Docker networking, port mapping, and JDBC configuration

---

## Key Backend Concepts Demonstrated
- Stateless authentication using JWT
- Custom Spring Security filter chain
- Transaction management and rollback
- Exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice`
- Production-like environment setup with Docker

---

## How to Run
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
